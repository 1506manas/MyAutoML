This is a Streamlit Machine Learning Web application by which we can train the data by uploading any csv file.

Install all the packages mentioned in the "requirements.txt"
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

****How it Works****

1) Upload the CSV file
2) We can see the head of the data.
3) We can see all the features(columns) of the csv file.
4) We can see the Correlations.
5) We can see the Descriptions.
6) We need to fill the targeted feature in the input text area.
7) Then select whether the training is for Regression or Classisfication.
8) Then the Web Application automatically trained the data using multiple Machine Learning models.
9) Represent the Mean Square Error and the R2 score of each model.
